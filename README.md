Exploratory data analysis for patterns and relationships between the complexity and popularity of boardgames.

## Scope
The data shows an exponential increase in the board games created in the recent decades. Since the dataset was created around beginning of 2021, we see a drop in the count of games created. 
For the purpose of this exercise we will limit our analysis to the time period from 1950 to 2000.

## Conclusion
There appears to be a slight positive correlation between Complexity and the Ratings. 

More complex games tend to be rated higher and highly rated games are slightly more complex.
